**CITS5552 Assessment**

The main assessment in this unit is the software project. You are expected to meet regularly with your team mates and with your client as appropriate. You should contact and meet with your client regularly. Everybody should keep a record of every meeting. Who was present, what was discussed, what tasks were assigned with what deadlines, and when the next meeting will be held. Students will be expected to show these notes to the unit coordinator upon request.

Remember that you should be spending 10 hours a week on this unit and so the quantity of work should be proportional to that amount of time. You will lose marks if it is not clear that all team members have put in at least 100 hours per semester.

**System Delivery (group/indidivual) (80%)**

At the end of week 12, the following should be delivered:

* The working system (35%)
* Source code hosted on a shared GitHub repository (20%)
* User manual for the system (10%)
* Video presentation (15%): You will create a video presentation (screen capture or talking to camera) of the project. This will be roughly 20 minutes long and will review the project, demonstrate the software and discuss what futrue plans could be. You should also discuss what worked and didn't work with the entire project.

Look at previous projects that are included in the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/uwacsp/CITS555X) for examples of how previous groups have documented this stage.

**Reflective Essay (20%, individual)**

The essay component will require all students to write an individual essay. The essay should be approximately 2,000 words. The essay should be a personal reflection of the project, what you individually learned and contributed. What worked well and what could have gone better. What means were used to communicate around project activities and milestones? Were they effective?
