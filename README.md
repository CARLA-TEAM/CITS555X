# CITS5551 and CITS552 Software Engineering Design Project Parts 1 and 2

This unit is taken over two semesters and parts 1 and 2 must be completed to fulfil the requirements of the unit. The project is a capstone experience in which students integrate and apply knowledge and skills acquired in earlier units to a substantial real-world design challenge relevant to their discipline. Students work in teams, typically with four to six members, and are supervised by an academic and/or industry mentor. Teams are responsible for managing their project as well as reporting against milestones and preparing the necessary design documentation. The academic objectives of the project are to lead students through a systematic engineering design and synthesis process and to better prepare them for professional practice as engineers. The focus of the unit is on teamwork skills and the design process.
