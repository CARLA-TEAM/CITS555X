ASSESSMENT

The main assessment in this unit is the software project. You are expected to meet regularly with your team mates and with your client as appropriate. You should contact and meet with your client as soon as possible to enable your team to get started. Everybody should keep a record of every meeting. Who was present, what was discussed, what tasks were assigned with what deadlines, and when the next meeting will be held. Students will be expected to show these notes to the unit coordinator upon request. They will also be required for peer review in the second part of the project (i.e., the unit CITS5552). Students will lose marks if they are not able to substantiate their assessments and opinions with documented evidence.

In the first few weeks, you will need to be working on the functional and technical specifications for the system and the project plan. You will need to come up to speed with the technologies involved in the project. You may not have the requisite experience or be familiar with the coding platform you have chosen and so you will all need to become familiar with these technologies. Remember that it is a requirement that *all* students be involved with *all* aspects of the project - everyone needs to code. This is either coding the product itself, or writing functional and system tests, deployment technologies or other tools. 

Functional and technical specification and project plan (group) (30%)

By week 7, the group will have prepared documentation to support the development of the project. This will include a functional specification that details what you have been asked to build. The format of this document can take a number of accepted forms - modeling diagrams, use cases, user stories, explicitly stated functional requirements (in the form of "the system shall"). Accompanying the functional specification will be a technical specification that will detail the technical aspects of the project. This will include decisions about development environment, languages, technologies. You will have to decide what platforms the product will be deployed on. To this extent, you will have access to development software and access to resources through Amazon Web Services as necessary. Your documents should have been approved by your client.

Prototype presentation and prototype (30% group/individual + 10% professional conduct)

 You will create a video presentation (screen capture or talking to camera) of the project. This will be roughly 10 minutes long and will introduce the project, talk about what the application is supposed to achieve, detail what decisions you made about scope and technology and then demonstrate the prototype and/or wireframes you have developed. 

 The team should also submit prototype code demonstrating key functionality to be delivered. Obviously, the full implementation of the system is not expected at this stage. Your prototype should include additional system mockups that are not included in the specifications, (any programming language suitable/chosen for the project) code snippets, HTML files, etc. There is no prescribed size or form for the document: it could be a 20 page report; or it could be a website, with prototype animations. This example provides a rough idea of the expected content (but not necessarily the expected format) of a specification.

While this is a group assessment component, to conform with the University's assessment policy, the actual group work will take up only 30%. Each individual member should separately submit the part that is under his/her responsibility to claim the remaining 10%. For instance, if you are responsible to investigate on the design constraints, then in the 10% individual component, you should go into more technical details about your investigation on design constraints. These extra technical details should not be included in the group part of the document.

In addition, a document outlining each individual's contribution should be submitted. This will be used, along with input from the client and evidence of activity on GitHub and Slack to allocate  10% mark for Professional Conduct. 

Essay (30%, individual)

The essay component will require members of the group to write an essay. The essay should be approximately 2500 words. The essay topic  for this semester is:



Software (and hardware) applications can have significant implications for the end users in terms of the impacts on their  individual rights such as the right to privacy and non-discrimination and the overall functioning of society. Thinking of applications such as those created by companies like Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple or Amazon discuss how the developers involved did not consider how their applications would be used and the unintended consequences of those applications on individuals and society as a whole. Should the developers have anticipated the the varied uses of their products and if so, what responsibility should they bear in those consequences? Does the  ACS Code of ethics have any relevance in the matter? Should their be laws or other regulations to stop this from happening in the future or do you think that the technology companies should simply provide a technological solution to any problems their software might cause?
